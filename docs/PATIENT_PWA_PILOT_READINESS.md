# Patient PWA Pilot Readiness

This checklist tracks the final gates before using the patient PWA in a supervised remote pilot. `docs/PATIENT_PWA_ARCHITECTURE.md` remains the product architecture authority, and `docs/PATIENT_PWA_DEPLOYMENT.md` remains the deployment split authority.

## Automated Local Gates

Run these before requesting pilot-readiness review:

```bash
cd client
npm test -- --reporter=dot
npm run lint
npm run build -- --debug
npm run build:surfaces
npm run verify:surface-builds
npm run verify:patient-pwa-readiness
npm run e2e:browser
```

For patient PWA deploy-preview smoke, first run a patient preview in one terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm run build:patient
npm run preview:patient -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173
```

Then run this from another terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm run e2e:patient-pwa
```

The patient PWA smoke gate checks:

- Patient app title is `Remote Assessment`.
- Patient entry UI renders.
- `patient.webmanifest` is served.
- `patient-sw.js` is served.
- Clinician auth route redirects back to patient entry in patient-surface mode.

To print a combined local/external readiness report after building surfaces:

```bash
cd client
npm run verify:patient-pwa-readiness
```

The command fails only for broken local build outputs by default. It reads `docs/PATIENT_PWA_PILOT_EVIDENCE.json` for repo-recorded hosted staging and licensed-stimuli evidence, and it keeps the real-device gate `blocked` until physical-device evidence is supplied. Use `node ../scripts/patient-pwa-readiness.mjs --fail-on-blocked` when a release process should fail while external gates remain blocked.

Use `node ../scripts/patient-pwa-readiness.mjs --external-only` only when inspecting repo-recorded hosted, stimuli, or real-device evidence without local surface build outputs. It is not a substitute for the automated local gates.

## Licensed Stimuli Gate

Before any clinical pilot, all enabled licensed visual stimuli must be present in private Supabase Storage.

Current pilot evidence: MoCA 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 licensed stimuli were verified in hosted Supabase project `jdkaxdtrukfxzlzspuua` on 2026-04-28. The evidence record is `docs/PATIENT_PWA_PILOT_EVIDENCE.json`.

Print the required manifest without contacting Supabase:

```bash
node scripts/verify-stimuli.mjs --all-versions --print-manifest
```

Verify local or hosted Storage after the licensed assets are uploaded:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=<project-url> SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-role-key> node scripts/verify-stimuli.mjs --all-versions
```

Keep licensed PDFs, extracted images, and service-role keys out of Git.

## Hosted Staging Gate

Hosted staging is complete for the current Netlify pilot hosts and remains subject to re-verification if the hosts, routing, or Supabase project change.

Current patient staging URL: `https://reakwind-remote-assessment-patient-staging.netlify.app`

Current clinician URL: `https://reakwind-remote-assessment-clinician.netlify.app`

For Netlify setup, use [NETLIFY_HOSTING.md](NETLIFY_HOSTING.md).

Required staging checks:

- Patient staging host serves `client/dist/patient-staging`.
- Clinician host serves `client/dist/clinician` or the existing clinician deployment.
- Patient staging shows the Hebrew `מצב בדיקה` banner.
- Patient host has HTTPS, manifest, icons, and service worker at the host root.
- Clinician routes are not discoverable from the patient PWA and redirect to patient entry when opened directly on the patient host.
- Supabase remote-changing work follows `docs/SUPABASE_RECONCILIATION.md` before deploys, migration pushes, storage-policy changes, or hosted E2E.
- Supabase MCP or the CLI fallback in `docs/SUPABASE_RECONCILIATION.md` confirms hosted migrations, Edge Functions, required secret names, storage expectations, and linked database lint/advisor status before physical-device evidence is collected.

To recheck hosted staging, run:

```bash
cd client
HOSTED_SUPABASE_URL=https://jdkaxdtrukfxzlzspuua.supabase.co PATIENT_STAGING_URL=https://reakwind-remote-assessment-patient-staging.netlify.app CLINICIAN_STAGING_URL=https://reakwind-remote-assessment-clinician.netlify.app npm run e2e:hosted-pwa
```

The hosted smoke requires HTTPS, checks the patient staging banner, validates manifest and service-worker availability at the patient host root, confirms clinician routes redirect away from the patient PWA, confirms patient PWA assets are absent from the clinician host, and verifies hosted Edge Function CORS for the patient and clinician origins.

## Real-Device Gate

Real-device checks stay blocked until the user tests the installed PWA on the target device.

Minimum device matrix:

| Device mode                 | Required checks                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| iPadOS Safari installed PWA | Install from patient staging, open in standalone mode, enter test number, complete preflight, drawing, audio, naming, completion, and resume after app relaunch. |
| Tablet browser fallback     | Same flow without installing; verify controls remain reachable with browser chrome.                                                                              |
| Phone portrait fallback     | Enter test number, complete preflight, naming, audio, and at least one drawing task; confirm phone drawing is captured and device context flags phone use.       |

Record device, OS/browser version, staging URL, MoCA version, and any skipped task in the release note or PR handoff.

Use `docs/PATIENT_PWA_REAL_DEVICE_EVIDENCE.example.json` as the evidence template. After filling it with the tested devices, include it in the readiness report:

```bash
cd client
PATIENT_PWA_REAL_DEVICE_EVIDENCE_FILE=../path/to/real-device-evidence.json npm run verify:patient-pwa-readiness
```

The evidence file must include passing runs for `ipad-installed-pwa`, `tablet-browser-fallback`, and `phone-portrait-fallback`. The readiness command validates required fields, HTTPS staging URLs, and the expected checks for each device mode.

To validate the evidence file without rebuilding local surface outputs:

```bash
cd client
PATIENT_PWA_REAL_DEVICE_EVIDENCE_FILE=../path/to/real-device-evidence.json node ../scripts/patient-pwa-readiness.mjs --external-only
```

For the current Netlify pilot hosts, start from `docs/PATIENT_PWA_REAL_DEVICE_EVIDENCE.netlify-template.json`. That file intentionally uses `pending` results; change a run to `pass` only after completing it on the named physical device.

## Pilot Readiness Status

The pilot is ready only when:

- Automated local gates pass.
- Hosted staging gate passes. Current Netlify evidence is recorded in `docs/PATIENT_PWA_PILOT_EVIDENCE.json`.
- Licensed stimuli gate passes for all enabled MoCA versions. Current hosted Supabase evidence is recorded in `docs/PATIENT_PWA_PILOT_EVIDENCE.json`.
- Real-device gate passes on the target iPad/tablet plus phone fallback.
- No completion-blocking autosave, drawing, audio, or stimulus-fetch issues remain open.

Current status: hosted staging and licensed stimuli are recorded as passing; physical iPad/tablet installed-PWA and phone fallback evidence remains the active blocker.
