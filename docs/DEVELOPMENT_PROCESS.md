# Development Process

This project uses Supabase as the current MVP runtime. The product architecture is the Remote Check app contract: clinician/session/patient/review/scoring workflows, API payloads, persisted evidence, and verification expectations. Keep platform-specific code isolated so Supabase can be replaced later without rewriting the product.

## Core Rules

- Start every change from latest `origin/main`.
- Work on a feature branch, preferably `codex/<short-scope>`.
- Keep each branch focused on one feature, bug fix, or cleanup.
- Open a normal, ready-for-review PR into `main` for every repo change after the relevant checks pass.
- Do not default to draft PRs. The current GitHub connector can create, close, and merge PRs, but the draft-to-ready mutation is unreliable. Use draft PRs only when explicitly needed, and record whether conversion requires the GitHub UI or a working `gh` login.
- Record verification performed, skipped checks, risks, and follow-up work in the PR.
- Update `docs/AGENT_LEARNINGS.md` before merge when review findings, recurring bugs, or new verification patterns produce reusable lessons for future agents.
- Merge only after explicit user approval for that PR.

## Feature Slice

Build features as complete vertical slices:

- Surface journey: clinician website or patient PWA screens, states, errors, and copy.
- App contract: request/response shapes, validation, status transitions, and permissions.
- Persistence: records, storage paths, audit events, and retryable outcomes.
- Review/scoring: deterministic scoring, manual review state, and finalization rules.
- Verification: unit tests, browser checks, local Supabase E2E when the flow touches backend behavior.
- Documentation: update `JOURNEY.md` when user-facing journey, backend journey, status, review, scoring, notification, or export behavior changes.
- Documentation: update `docs/AGENT_LEARNINGS.md` when the branch teaches a durable engineering lesson beyond the immediate code diff.

## Provider Boundaries

Use Supabase directly where MVP speed matters, and keep usage behind stable app boundaries:

- Auth: clinician identity, session lookup, and permission checks.
- Database: repository-style reads/writes for cases, sessions, results, reports, reviews, audits, and notifications.
- Storage: private object paths, upload/download, signed URLs, content types, and retention rules.
- Functions/API: Edge Function handlers expose app-level contracts such as `create-session`, `start-session`, `save-audio`, `complete-session`, and review updates.
- Notifications: email/SMS/transcription providers sit behind swappable service functions.

Client code should depend on app concepts rather than database details. Shared scoring, validation, task mapping, and report logic should remain provider-independent whenever practical.

## Surface Boundaries

The product has two frontend surfaces:

- Clinician website: authenticated dashboard for case/session management, review, scoring, finalization, and exports.
- Patient PWA: tablet/phone-first assessment app for test-number start, system check, drawing/audio/task evidence, autosave, and completion.

Read `docs/PATIENT_PWA_ARCHITECTURE.md` before changing patient routes, installability, service-worker behavior, deployment targets, mobile/tablet layout, drawing UX, or cache policy. Read `docs/PATIENT_PWA_DEPLOYMENT.md` before changing surface build scripts, deployment output directories, host fallback rules, or patient PWA cache headers.

Rules:

- Do not redesign patient tasks as desktop website pages.
- Do not expose clinician navigation inside the installed patient PWA.
- Keep PWA caching to static app-shell assets unless a later architecture decision explicitly approves more.
- Keep patient PHI, task evidence, Supabase API responses, signed URLs, PDF exports, and CSV exports out of service-worker caches.
- Verify patient changes in phone and tablet viewports, and in installed PWA/home-screen mode before clinical pilot.

## Verification Tiers

Use the smallest check set that covers the risk:

- Docs-only: link/search verification is enough.
- Frontend-only: unit tests, lint, build, and targeted browser checks.
- Backend/session/storage/review/scoring changes: unit tests, lint, build, Deno checks, local Supabase functions, and local browser/Supabase E2E.
- Hosted Supabase work: follow `docs/SUPABASE_RECONCILIATION.md`, inspect drift first, get explicit approval before remote-changing commands, and record rollback notes for destructive actions.

GitHub CI is the stable baseline. Local Supabase E2E is the required backend confidence check until hosted preview environments are intentionally configured and trusted.

## Platform Portability

When adding backend behavior, define the app contract first:

- Name the user action and lifecycle transition.
- Specify the request, response, and error cases.
- Decide what data is stored and what is returned to the browser.
- Keep private credentials, bearer tokens, storage object paths, and signed URLs scoped to the smallest necessary surface.
- Put deterministic domain logic in shared modules instead of embedding it in platform glue.
- Keep provider assumptions visible in docs or code names when they are unavoidable.

## Review Checklist

Before asking to merge:

- The branch is current with `origin/main`.
- The diff is focused and understandable.
- The app journey still matches `JOURNEY.md`.
- Patient data handling follows the MVP privacy guardrails.
- Scoring remains deterministic/manual according to the active manual.
- Supabase-specific changes are isolated and documented.
- Verification results and skipped checks are listed in the PR.
